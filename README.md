NeuPet
======

Evolving neural networks-controlled virtual pets -- a petri dish in your computer.

Why?
----

I'm very faschinated by evolutionary algritms, virtual life and artificcial intelligence. This project combines them, and since I had the iea, it has been irresistable to me.

How?
----

NeuPet is heavily inspired by a MS-DOS game called [Evolve! Lite](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPQBexmrvEQ) I found on a shareware CD in the nineties, called Game Empire. But instead of the pseudo celluar automata, I use neural networks to control each creature.


TODO
----

* Pets should not be able to move themselves, just report a wanted action to the world.
* Pets should be presented a pre-rotated and filtered piece of the world they can sense. No access to the world needed.
* Pets should not know in what direction they are facing, just like they don't know where they are. Let the World handle this.
