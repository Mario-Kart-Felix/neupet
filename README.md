NeuPet
======

Evolving neural networks-controlled virtual pets -- a petri dish in your computer.

Why?
----

I'm very faschinated by evolutionary algritms, virtual life and artificcial intelligence. This project combines them, and since I had the iea, it has been irresistable to me.

How?

NeuPet is heavily inspired by a MS-DOS game called [Evolve! Lite](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kPQBexmrvEQ) I found on a shareware CD in the nineties, called Game Empire. But instead of the pseudo celluar automata, I use neural networks to control each creature.
